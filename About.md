FilterLists helps to protect your privacy and security when using the Internet. It provides a comprehensive directory of subscription lists to block advertisements, malware, trackers, and other general annoyances. First, install one of the tools mentioned below under "Software Support." Then, you can subscribe to a set of these lists inside of that software. If you need help or have a comment/question, open an [Issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues).

## Background

Using a software firewall (adblocker) has become a key tool in protecting one's privacy online. While the current business model of the "free" Internet relies upon advertising revenue, publishers have become too flippant about tracking users without their consent. Advertising networks track users' browsing habits around the Internet building lucrative profiles to exploit for targeted marketing or big data research. Until Internet publishers develop more transparency or a new business model, we must continue to take the protection of our privacy into our hands.

Typical adblockers run as an extension in popular web browsers. As we browse the Internet, they compare HTTP requests to their list of hosts and filters to selectively block advertisements, trackers, and general annoyances. This filtering helps to protect the surfer's privacy, prevents [malvertising attacks](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/malvertising-is-cybercriminals-latest-sweet-spot/ "Why Malvertising Is Cybercriminals' Latest Sweet Spot - Wired"), and [reduces bandwidth requirements](http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/08/blocking-ads-can-cut-network-traffic-25-to-40-study-shows/ "Blocking Ads Can Cut Network Traffic 25% to 40%, Study Shows - VentureBeat"). Many contributors work hard to maintain these filter lists for anyone to use. Locating and selecting these lists, however, has not historically been very easy. **FilterLists is the independent, comprehensive directory of filter and host lists for advertisements, trackers, malware, and annoyances.**

## FilScore<sup>beta</sup>

FilScore continues to evolve into a general score for lists based on factors such as popularity, quality, update frequency, update recency, support, and coverage. It is not meant to be a final quality score for each list, but rather to provide visitors with an approximation as to which lists are of higher subjective quality than others. It primarily serves as a more meaningful way to sort the lists than merely alphabetical. Visit this [GitHub Project](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/projects/1) to learn more and contribute to this feature.
